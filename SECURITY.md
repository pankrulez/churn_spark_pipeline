# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is intended for learning, experimentation, and portfolio use.  
Only the most recent version available on the `main` branch is actively maintained and supported.

Older commits, releases, forks, or downstream uses are not monitored for security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or suspect a security-related issue, report it responsibly.

❌ **Do not open a public GitHub issue** for security findings.  
Public disclosure before remediation can cause unnecessary risk.

✅ **Report the issue privately** using one of the following methods:
- Contact the repository owner through their GitHub profile  
- Use a private communication channel if one is explicitly provided

Your report should include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Affected files, components, or workflows
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable
- Potential impact and severity (data exposure, integrity, availability, etc.)
- Any suggested mitigations, if known

Well-documented reports lead to faster and more effective resolution.

## Review and Response Process

After a vulnerability is reported:
- The report will be reviewed as soon as reasonably possible
- Valid issues will be prioritized based on risk and impact
- Reasonable efforts will be made to provide a fix or mitigation

This project does not guarantee response or remediation timelines, but all good-faith reports will be evaluated.

## Disclosure Policy

- Security issues will not be publicly disclosed until a fix or mitigation is available, when feasible
- Coordinated disclosure is preferred to minimize risk to users
- Public acknowledgement may be provided after resolution, at the project maintainer’s discretion

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- Source code in this repository
- Machine learning pipelines and training workflows
- Data handling, preprocessing, and storage logic
- Dependency definitions and configuration included in the project

The following are **out of scope**:
- Third-party datasets
- External services, platforms, or APIs used for experimentation
- Vulnerabilities introduced by local environments, forks, or modified versions of this repository

## Limitations

This is not a production system. Security best practices are applied where reasonable, but the project is provided **as-is** without guarantees of security, stability, or ongoing support.
